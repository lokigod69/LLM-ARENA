# üß™ LLM Arena Simplified Flow Testing Checklist

## Overview
This checklist verifies that the simplified PLAY/STOP flow works correctly after removing the step functionality.

## ‚úÖ Core Functionality Tests

### 1. **Basic PLAY/STOP Flow**
- [ ] **Start Debate**: Enter topic and click PLAY button
  - [ ] Debate should start automatically
  - [ ] Messages should appear alternately in Model A and Model B columns
  - [ ] Turn counter should increment
  - [ ] PLAY button should be disabled during active debate
  - [ ] STOP button should be enabled during active debate

- [ ] **Stop Debate**: Click STOP button during active debate
  - [ ] Debate should stop immediately
  - [ ] Loading indicators should disappear
  - [ ] PLAY button should be enabled
  - [ ] STOP button should be disabled
  - [ ] Sliders should become enabled

- [ ] **Fresh Start**: Start new debate after stopping
  - [ ] Previous messages should be cleared
  - [ ] New debate should start with current slider settings
  - [ ] Turn counter should reset to 0

### 2. **Slider Behavior**
- [ ] **When Stopped**: 
  - [ ] All personality sliders should be enabled
  - [ ] Slider changes should be reflected immediately
  - [ ] Emoji levels should update correctly
  - [ ] Model selection dropdowns should be enabled

- [ ] **When Active**:
  - [ ] All personality sliders should be disabled
  - [ ] Model selection dropdowns should be disabled
  - [ ] Max turns slider should be disabled

- [ ] **Persistence**:
  - [ ] Slider settings should persist when starting new debate
  - [ ] Model selections should persist between debates

### 3. **Oracle Functionality**
- [ ] **When Stopped**:
  - [ ] Oracle panel should be accessible
  - [ ] Oracle analysis should work with existing debate data
  - [ ] Oracle results should display correctly

- [ ] **When Active**:
  - [ ] Oracle should be disabled/inaccessible during active debate

### 4. **Auto-Step Process**
- [ ] **Automatic Progression**:
  - [ ] Debate should progress automatically without user intervention
  - [ ] Each model should take turns responding
  - [ ] Responses should appear with proper attribution
  - [ ] Process should continue until max turns reached

- [ ] **Max Turns Limit**:
  - [ ] Debate should stop automatically when max turns reached
  - [ ] Final state should be same as manual stop
  - [ ] Turn counter should match max turns setting

### 5. **Error Handling**
- [ ] **API Errors**:
  - [ ] Network errors should not crash the application
  - [ ] Error messages should be displayed appropriately
  - [ ] Debate should stop gracefully on persistent errors

- [ ] **Invalid Input**:
  - [ ] Empty topics should be rejected
  - [ ] Very long topics should be handled
  - [ ] Special characters in topics should work

### 6. **UI State Consistency**
- [ ] **Loading States**:
  - [ ] Correct model should show loading indicator
  - [ ] Loading should clear when response received
  - [ ] Multiple loading states should not occur simultaneously

- [ ] **Button States**:
  - [ ] PLAY button: Enabled only when stopped and topic entered
  - [ ] STOP button: Enabled only when debate active
  - [ ] Button labels should be clear and consistent

- [ ] **Message Display**:
  - [ ] Messages should appear in correct columns
  - [ ] Timestamps should be accurate
  - [ ] Message formatting should be preserved
  - [ ] Scroll behavior should work correctly

### 7. **Performance Tests**
- [ ] **Memory Usage**:
  - [ ] No memory leaks during long debates
  - [ ] Proper cleanup when stopping debates
  - [ ] Efficient state updates

- [ ] **Responsiveness**:
  - [ ] UI should remain responsive during API calls
  - [ ] Stop button should work immediately
  - [ ] No UI freezing during auto-step process

## üêõ Known Issues to Watch For

### Previously Fixed Issues
- [x] ~~TypewriterText "text.split is not a function" error~~
- [x] ~~stepTurn "prevMessage?.substring is not a function" error~~
- [x] ~~Complex resume logic causing state inconsistencies~~

### Potential New Issues
- [ ] Auto-step process not stopping when requested
- [ ] State inconsistencies between UI and backend
- [ ] Race conditions in rapid start/stop cycles
- [ ] Memory leaks from setTimeout in auto-step

## üîß Debug Console Commands

Use these in browser console to debug issues:

```javascript
// Check current debate state
console.log('Debate State:', window.debugState);

// Force stop debate
window.forceStop && window.forceStop();

// Check for memory leaks
console.log('Active timeouts:', window.activeTimeouts);
```

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

The simplified flow is working correctly when:

1. **PLAY button** starts auto-running debate until completion or stop
2. **STOP button** immediately stops debate and enables all controls
3. **No step functionality** is visible or accessible to users
4. **Sliders work** as expected (disabled during debate, enabled when stopped)
5. **Oracle works** when debate is stopped
6. **No runtime errors** in browser console
7. **Clean state management** with no leftover processes
